# FIRandIIRbandpassFilters
This project outlines the design process of FIR and IIR digital bandpass filters using MATLAB 2020a as the
programming environment for the project. For FIR filters, the windowing method (in conjunction with the
Kaiser window) is used whereas, for IIR filters, the bilinear transformation with elliptic approximation method
is used.
